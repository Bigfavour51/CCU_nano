# CCU_nano: Intelligent Cooling Control Unit

**CCU_nano** is a sophisticated embedded system designed to monitor and control cooling devices, such as refrigerators. It measures critical parameters like device temperature, power consumption (voltage, current, power), 
and ambient room conditions (temperature and humidity). Equipped with a CYD display screen, the system offers an intuitive user interface built using EEZ Studio, allowing users to view sensor readings and set threshold values to automate 
load control via a relay mechanism.

## Project Overview

The **CCU_nano** project aims to enhance the efficiency and safety of cooling devices by providing real-time monitoring and control. By analyzing temperature and power consumption metrics, 
the system can make informed decisions to activate or deactivate the cooling load, ensuring optimal performance and energy savings.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Tracks device temperature, voltage, current, power consumption, and ambient room conditions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: CYD display with EEZ Studio-designed UI for real-time data visualization and user interaction.
- **Automated Control**: Relay mechanism triggers based on user-defined thresholds for temperature and power consumption.
- **Data Logging**: Records historical data for analysis and troubleshooting.
- **Modular Design**: Easily adaptable to various cooling devices and environments.

## System Architecture

The system comprises the following components:

- **Sensors**:
  - Temperature sensor for the cooling device.
  - Voltage and current sensors to monitor power consumption.
  - Ambient temperature and humidity sensor for room conditions.
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 for processing sensor data and controlling the relay.
- **Display**: CYD screen with UI developed in EEZ Studio.
- **Relay Module**: Controls the power supply to the cooling device based on sensor inputs and user-defined thresholds.
